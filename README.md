# RSS3 Node

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, you need to create a node on the explorer: [RSS3 Explorer](https://explorer.rss3.io/nodes).

Additionally, ensure that your Zeabur account is upgraded to at least the Developer Plan ($5/month).

## Deployment

You only need to fill in two fields in the RSS3-Node service:

- **Operator EVM Address**: Your wallet address (which is also your node address).
- **Operator Signature**: The challenge signature obtained here: https://explorer.rss3.io/nodes/YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS. (Click the "Signature" button to complete the challenge and copy your signature to paste here.)
- **Custom Domain**: The domain name you want to use for your node.
- **Global Indexer Endpoint**: The global indexer endpoint for your node. (You can use the default value.)

After the service starts, it will join the RSS3 Network as a lightweight RSS3 Node.
